- 👋 Hi, I’m @bbaileywick.  I have only one website left.  It is for personal history and production -- like geometric graphics.
- 👀 I’m interested in trying to update my website to use Level 8 or 8.1 of PHP. My attempts have been thwarted by an error message with my website-space provider says is probably an issue with my Gantry code that I introduced way back around 2012 or so.   
- 🌱 I’m currently learning GIMP and trying to create geometric animations.   
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...My concern is not with development of any code -- at least at present. I am a website creator attempting to update PHP, getting past an error warning, and NOT breaking my website.  I am an 83 year old former software person who retired in 2001 and is really behind the times.  
- 📫 How to reach me.  My email is bevbill3839@gmail.com.
